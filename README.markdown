# DDMathParser

You have an `NSString`.  You want an `NSNumber`.  Previously, you would have to rely on [abusing `NSPredicate`](http://tumblr.com/xqopow93r) to turn your string into an `NSExpression` that you could then evaluate.  However, this has a major flaw:  extending it to support functions that aren't built-in to `NSExpression` provided for some awkward syntax.  So if you really need `sin()`, you have to jump through some intricate hoops to get it.

You could also have used [`GCMathParser`](http://apptree.net/parser.htm).  This, however, isn't extensible at all.  So if you really needed a `stddev()` function, you're out of luck.

Thus, `DDMathParser`.  It is written to be identical to `NSExpression` in all the ways that matter (in fact, it actually uses `NSExpression` to evaluate many of its built-in functions), but with the major addition that you can define new functions as you need.

## Features

### Registering Functions

Registering new functions is easy.  You just need a block, a name, and the number of arguments the function accepts.  So for example:

    DDMathFunction function = ^ DDExpression* (NSArray *args, NSDictionary *variables, DDMathEvaluator *evaluator, NSError **error) {
      NSNumber * n = [[args objectAtIndex:0] evaluateWithSubstitutions:variables evaluator:evaluator error:error];
      NSNumber * result = [NSNumber numberWithDouble:[n doubleValue] * 42.0f];
      return [DDExpression numberExpressionWithNumber:result];
    };
    [[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] registerFunction:function forName:@"multiplyBy42"];
    
    NSLog(@"%@", [[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] evaluateString:@"multiplyBy42(3)" withSubstitutions:nil]);  //logs "126"
    
You can also unregister added functions.  You cannot unregister built-in functions, nor can they be overridden.
    
Function names must begin with a letter, and can contain letters and digits.  Functions are case-insensitive.  (`mUlTiPlYbY42` is the same as `multiplyby42`)

Functions are registered with a specific instance of `DDMathEvaluator`.  The simplest approach is to register everything with the shared instance (`[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator]`).  However, should you only need certain functions available in certain contexts, you can allocate and initialize any number of `DDMathEvaluator` objects.  All math evaluators recognize the built-in functions.
    
### Variables

If you don't know what the value of a particular term should be when the string is constructed, that's ok; simply use a variable:

    NSString *math = @"6 * $a";
    
Then when you figure out what the value is supposed to be, you can pass it along in the substitution dictionary:

    NSDictionary *variableSubstitutions = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:7] forKey:@"a"];
    NSLog(@"%@", [[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] evaluateString:math withSubstitutions:variableSubstitutions]); //logs "42"
    
Variables are denoted in the source string as beginning with `$` and can contain numbers or letters.  They are case sensitive.  (`$a` is not the same as `$A`)
    
### Associativity

By default, all binary operators are left associative.  That means if you give a string, such as `@"1 - 2 - 3"`, it will be parsed as `@"(1 - 2) - 3`.

The exception to this is the power operator (`**`), which has its associativity determined at runtime.  The reason for this is that the power operator is supposed to be right associative, but is interpreted by `NSPredicate` as left associative ([rdar://problem/8692313](rdar://problem/8692313)).  `DDParser` performs a test to match the associativity used by `NSPredicate`.

If you want this operator to be parsed with specific associativity, you can do so like this:

    DDParser *parser = [DDParser parserWithString:@"2 ** 3 ** 2"];
    [parser setPowerAssociativity:DDOperatorAssociativityRight];
    NSError *error = nil;
    DDExpression *e = [parser parsedExpressionWithError:&error];
   
All binary operators can have their associativity changed this way.  If you want to change the associativity of an operator for all future parsings, you can use the class methods on `DDParser` to do so.  For example:

	[DDParser setDefaultPowerAssociativity:DDOperatorAssociativityRight];
	NSLog(@"%@", [@"2 ** 3 ** 2" numberByEvaluatingString]); //logs 512
	
Changing the default associativity only affects parsers instantiated after the change.  It does not affect existing parsers.

### Operators

`DDMathEvaluator` recognizes all common mathematical operators:

- `+` - addition (also as a unary plus)
- `-` - subtraction (also negation)
- `*` (or `x`) - multiplication
- `/` - division
- `%` - modulus
- `!` - factorial
- `**` - exponentiation
- `&` - bitwise and
- `|` - bitwise or
- `^` - bitwise xor
- `~` - bitwise not
- `<<` - bitwise left shift
- `>>` - bitwise right shift

### Implicit Multiplication

The parser recognizes implicit multiplication.  For example, we can write `3(4)` and understand that the answer should be `12`.  Implicit multiplication is applied when a number, variable, or closing parenthesis are followed by either a number, variable, function, or opening parenthesis.

A full explanation of how the implicit multiplication is handled is in the source of `DDMathStringTokenizer.m`.

### Built-in functions

In addition to the functions defined by the operators above, the following functions are built in:

Functions that take > 1 parameter

- `sum()` - returns a sum of the passed parameters.  Can take 1 or more parameters.
- `count()` - returns the number of passed parameters
- `min()` - returns the minimum of the passed parameters
- `max()` - returns the maximum of the passed parameters
- `median()` - returns the median of the passed parameters
- `stddev()` - returns the standard deviation of the passed parameters
- `average()` - returns the average of the passed parameters

- `nthroot()` - returns the n<sup>th</sup> root of a number.  For example, `nthroot(27,3)` returns the cube root of 27, or 3.

Functions that take 1 parameter:

- `sqrt()` - returns the square root of the passed parameter
- `log()` - returns the base 10 log of the passed parameter
- `ln()` - returns the base e log of the passed parameter
- `log2()` - returns the base 2 log of the passed parameter
- `exp()` - returns e raised to the power of the passed parameter
- `ceil()` - returns the passed parameter rounded up
- `floor()` - returns the passed parameter rounded down

- `sin()` - returns the sine of the passed parameter (in radians)
- `cos()` - returns the cosine of the passed parameter (in radians)
- `tan()` - returns the tangent of the passed parameter (in radians)
- `asin()` - returns (in radians) the arcsine of the passed parameter
- `acos()` - returns (in radians) the arccosine of the passed parameter
- `atan()` - returns (in radians) the arctangent of the passed parameter
- `sinh()` - returns the hyperbolic sine of the passed parameter
- `cosh()` - returns the hyperbolic cosine of the passed parameter
- `tanh()` - returns the hyperbolic tangent of the passed parameter
- `asinh()` - returns the hyperbolic arcsine of the passed parameter
- `acosh()` - returns the hyperbolic arccosine of the passed parameter
- `atanh()` - returns the hyperbolic arctangent of the passed parameter
- all the inverses of the above trigonometric functions (`csc`, `sec`, `cotan`, `acsc`, `asec`, `acotan`, `csch`, `sech`, `cotanh`, `acsch`, `asech`, `acotanh`)

- `dtor()` - converts the passed parameter from degrees to radians
- `rtod()` - converts the passed parameter from radians to degrees

Functions that take no parameters:

- `phi()` - returns the value of ϕ (the Golden Ratio).  Also recognized as `ϕ()`
- `pi()` - returns the value of π.  Also recognized as `π()`
- `pi_2()` - returns the value of π/2
- `pi_4()` - returns the value of π/4
- `sqrt2()` - returns the value of the square root of 2
- `e()` - returns the value of e
- `log2e()` - returns the value of the log base 2 of e
- `log10e()` - returns the value of the log base 10 of e
- `ln2()` - returns the value of the log base e of 2
- `ln10()` - returns the value of the log base e of 10

#### Aliases

Functions can also have aliases.  For example, the following are equivalent:

    average(1,2,3)
    avg(1,2,3)
    mean(1,2,3)
  
You can create your own aliases as well.  If "`acotanh`" is too long to type for you, feel free to do:

    [[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator] addAlias:@"acth" forFunctionName:@"acotanh"];

## Usage

Simply copy the "DDMathParser" subfolder into your project, `#import "DDMathParser.h"`, and you're good to go.  A demo target is included as part of the project.  It shows how to evaluate a user-entered string, with support for variables.

There are several ways to evaluate strings, depending on how much customization you want to do.  Most of these options require an `NSError **` parameter, although some do not.

- If you use one of the options that does *not* accept an `NSError **`, then any tokenization, parsing, or evaluation errors will be `NSLog`ged.
- If you use one of the options that does accept an `NSError **`, then you *must* supply one.  Failing to do so will probably result in a crash.

### NSString

    NSLog(@"%@", [@"1 + 2" numberByEvaluatingString]);
    
Useful for the simplest evaluations (ie, no variables).  Uses the `[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator]` and all functions registered with it.

### NSString with substitutions

    NSDictionary *s = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:42] forKey:@"a"];
    NSLog(@"%@", [@"1 + $a" numberByEvaluatingStringWithSubstitutions:s]);
    
Also:

	NSDictionary *s = [NSDictionary dictionaryWithObject:[NSNumber numberWithInt:42] forKey:@"a"];
	NSError *error = nil;
	NSLog(@"%@", [@"1 + $a" numberByEvaluatingStringWithSubstitutions:s error:&error]);
    
Useful for specifying variable substitutions.  Uses the default `[DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator]`.
    
### DDExpression

	NSError *error = nil;
	DDExpression *e = [DDExpression expressionFromString:@"1 + 2" error:&error];
	NSLog(@"%@", [e evaluateWithSubstitutions:nil evaluator:nil]);
	
Useful for specifying variable substitutions or a custom evaluator.

### DDMathEvaluator

    DDMathEvaluator *eval = [DDMathEvaluator sharedMathEvaluator];
    NSLog(@"%@", [eval evaluateString:@"1 + 2" withSubstitutions:nil]);
    
Useful for specifying variable substitutions or a custom evaluator.

### DDParser

	NSError *error = nil;
    DDParser *parser = [DDParser parserWithString:@"1 + 2" error:&error];
    DDExpression *e = [parser parsedExpressionWithError:&error];
    NSLog(@"%@", [e evaluateWithSubstitutions:nil evaluator:nil error:&error]);
    
Useful for specifying a custom parser or custom operator associativities, specifying variables, or specifying a custom evaluator.

### DDMathStringTokenizer

    NSError *error = nil;
    DDMathStringTokenizer *t = [DDMathStringTokenizer tokenizerWithString:@"1 + 2" error:&error];
    DDParser *parser = [DDParser parserWithTokenizer:t error:&error];
    DDExpression *e = [parser parsedExpressionWithError:&error];
    NSLog(@"%@", [e evaluateWithSubstitutions:nil evaluator:nil error:&error]);
    
Useful for specifying a custom tokenizer.  An example of a custom tokenizer is included in the source.  It shows how to recognize certain functions without parentheses (e, pi, etc).

## Precision

`DDMathParser` strives to be as precise as reasonable, often at the cost of performance.  Almost all of the functions used in expression evaluation are implemented in terms of `NSDecimal` structs, with a couple of exceptions:

- Raising a number to a negative or non-integral power
- Taking the factorial of a negative or non-integral number
- Logarithmic functions: `log`, `log2`, `ln`, `exp`, etc

In these cases, the numbers are converted to `doubles` and then are computed with the built-in functions.  It is conceivable that this may change in the future.  All other functions, including square- and nth-roots, the trigonometric functions, standard deviation, etc, are all implemented with NSDecimal functions.

## Compatibility

`DDMathParser` requires blocks, so therefore is only compatible with iOS 4+ and Mac OS X 10.6+.

`DDMathParser` requires the [Clang](http://clang.llvm.org/) compiler.

Though it has not been tested, `DDMathParser` should be fully compatible with garbage collected applications.
